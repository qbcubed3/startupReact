# Startup Specification

## Elevator Pitch

Have you ever felt that you wish you could know how to be more happy on a day-to-day basis? My startup is a website that tracks a user's happiness, and activities for a day and then tracks said data throughout a period and gives feedback on the data. Every day the user can log onto the app and be asked to give a scale for how happy they were that day. After putting this rating in they will be able to select what they did that day. This valuable data can be used to then figure out what activities make you happier and suggest how to improve your own life. This application will help people be more mindful of what they are doing in their day-to-day lives, how this affects their happiness, and what they can do to be more happy.

## Key Features

* A quick and easy survey that tracks the daily happiness of the user
* A survey that allows users to pick from a list of options for what they did today, and also allows them to create their own, which will be saved for all later surveys.
* Data is stored in a database that allows the user to track their progress over time
* Feedback on how you can better use your time to be more happy based on the data already given
* Graphical representations of the data showing how your happiness has changed over time and how often you are doing certain activities, easily downloadable too
* Notifications will be given that remind users to do the surveys at a user-specified time of the day
## How Technologies Will Be Used

### Authentication 
    
Users will be able to create personal accounts which will be connected to the data that they upload to the server through the daily surveys and the analysis of said data

### Database Data

The data collected through the daily surveys will be stored inside a database. It will hold the daily happiness levels, the activities done every day, and even the survey categories that the user comes up with themselves.

### WebSocket Data
    
This will be used to allow users to set up a time to be sent a reminder to do their daily survey. They can choose any time of the day. it will also update the graphs and statistics in real time to reflect a survey that was just taken.

### HTML Deliverable

For this part of the project I built out the basic HTML for the webpage

**HTML** - for html I created 4 different pages, those being the login page, home page, statistics, and daily survey. I used only HTML and just created the basic content of each of these pages. I used BODY, NAV, MAIN, HEADER, and FOOTER within my HTML and used them correctly in order to organize my webpage better.

**Links** - I put the links to all the other pages in my website at the top of the page and then in the how to get started part of the homepage I put links to all the parts I was referencing within that paragraph.

**Text Content** - I populated each of the pages with the proper text content, putting what I could inside of the website at the time, and then describing what I couldn't do now but will do later.

**3rd Party Service Calls** - I put a placeholder for where I am going to be storing data in the database and then also fetching data from the database.

**Images** - I added an image of a smiley face as the image on a tab and then also added a smiley face at the bottom of each footer.

**Login PlaceHolder** - I added both a text box for the username and password and then a submit button to login. I also added a username placeholder at the top of the page, which I will move once I apply CSS to my project and can move it to the top right more easily.

**Database** - I left a placeholder at the end of the survey section so that I can put all that data from the survey into the database and then also there is nothing in the statistics page yet because that is one big placeholder because all that will come from the data from the database.

**WebSocket** - The statistics page also has a placeholder from this because websocket will be used to update the statistics and then also ping peope to remind them to do the daily survey.

### CSS Deliverable

**Properly Styled CSS header, footer, main** - Done

**Properly Styled CSS Navigation Elements** - Put at the side in a navigation menu, and change when hovered over

**Responsive to Window Resizing** - All elements change to fit the size of the current window

**Properly Styled CSS Application Elements** - Used CSS to change the look of checkboxes, text boxes, range meter, etc.

**Properly Styled CSS Text Elements** - Used CSS to make text look cleaner and changed color in some spots

**Properly styled CSS Application Images** - used CSS in order to put images where I want them to be on my webpage using flexboxes.

### Javascript Deliverable

**Support for Future Logins** - Done, moves the webpage to the survey page once logged in.

**Support for Future Database** - Currently tracks the results from each survey in local storage. This will be tracked in database storage eventually

**Support for Future Websocket** - Has a popup that reminds the user to do the survey. Right now it goes at random times, but Websocket will be used to make it appear at the right time.

**Application Logic** - The survey is fully useable with selectable options and a slideable rank. This data is parsed and saved. I also added the logic to take the data and use it to create a graph with correct labels and values for the average happiness when they do certain activities.

### Service Deliverable

**Create an HTTP service using Node.js and Express** - Done

**Frontend served up using Express static middleware** - Done, used express to communicate between the front end and the back end

**Your frontend calls third party service endpoints** - Done, called a 3rd party web API that chooses a random joke and put them on each page.

**Your backend provides service endpoints** - Done, created all the service endpoints that were necessary for my application and server to run

**Your frontend calls your service endpoints** - Done, implemented and used each of my service endpoints in my frontend.

### Login Deliverable

**Supports new user registration** - Done. Users can Register/login on the homepage of the website.

**Supports existing user authentication** - Done. Allows Users to login to their pre-existing user accounts.

**Stores application data in MongoDB** - Done. Stores the users authentication and survey data in mongodb to be used and accessed later

**Stores and retrieves credentials in MongoDB** - Uses MongoDB to store users and also authTokens to validate their usage of the app

**Restricts application functionality based opon authentication** - Done. If the has no authToken or a bad one then they will not be able to see any stats, and the data from the survey will not be saved.

### Websocket Deliverable

**Backend listens for a websocket connection** - Done. The backend listens for a websocket connection.

**Frontend makes Websocket connection** - Done. The front end creates a new Websocket connection when needed.

**Data sent over Websocket Connection** - Done. Chat feature is implemented and sends messages over the websocket connection. Ping pong system is also set up that sends information over the websocket connection too. Also has a popup that appears at 7 pm every day that reminds the user to take the daily survey. This is called by websocket sending a message that tells the website to pull up the popup.

**Websocket data displayed in the chat** - Done. The chat feature allows users to send a message to the chat, and then Websocket is used to distribute that message to everyone else in realtime to have a realtime chat.

### React Deliverable

**Bundled Using Vite** - Done.

**Multiple functional react components** - Done. Ported everything to react.

**React Router** - Done. I built a react router that allows the user to navigate through the website.

**React Hooks** - Done. I used hooks to store and alter data throughout the webpage.
