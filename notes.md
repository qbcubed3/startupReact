# notes

This file is going to contain my notes that I can use on both the midterm and the final

## github

This is what I learned in the first assignment learning about github

The way that github works is that it allows people to collaboratively work on a project together and it handles merging the different changes that people make. This is done by commiting your changes to the central repository and then when people change the same line a warning pops up and lets you choose which change to keep. You can also fork a repository creating your own version of the repository


## CSS

CSS works in conjunction with HTML in order to create a design for the website and make it look better

Should be connceted into HTML using the link object in the header but can be done in other ways too like putting it directly in the document using style.

CSS works by adding modifiers to different pieces of text like using "padding" to specify extra padding for some text or an object.

It works in a cascading manner so you start by setting the header to a color and it will set everything but then you can get more specific and just put like the paragraphs to green.
